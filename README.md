# Generating the CSV files
In the `extractor` folder, there are the PDF files and a python script that extracts the data and generates the CSV files neccesary for the Rust library.
To generate these files, run this command: `cd extractor && python3 extractor.py`. Note that it might take a minute or so to extract all the data and generate the CSV files.
